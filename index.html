            <li>Children in the Weald, a small area in the southeast of England, began playing cricket on the streets sometime in the 16th century. But little did they know that it would be the genesis of a game that would be remembered, admired, and throned by millions of people.</li>
            <li>A cricket bat is made of willow wood. This is commonly found in the Northern hemisphere during extreme cold seasons. A fun fact is that you can usually find it in Indian regions such as Jammu and Kashmir, which is why it is now known as the Kashmir willow. These are known to provide the necessary strength and compression for a cricket ball.</li>
            <li>Cricket matches are usually quite long, especially when everyone is anticipating to see who will win. The longest recorded cricket match was played between England and South Africa in Durban. It is also used for the timeless test. It lasted nearly 90 days and saw over 683 overs bowled.</li>
            <li>Women's power has triumphed once more, this time in the cricket franchise. The first world cup winner was the England women's team in 1973, two years before the first men's cricket event. Following that, they have definitely demonstrated much valour and precision, bringing their game into their cricket franchise by many victories</li>
            <li>If you've ever wondered why cricket isn't included in the Olympics, here's your answer. The Olympics in Paris in 1900 wanted cricket to be a part of their games. At the time, the only participants were the United Kingdom and France. Cricket's inability to be officially included in the Olympics was undoubtedly due to a lack of participants. Is it possible that cricket will be included in the Olympics soon? Only time will tell.</li>
